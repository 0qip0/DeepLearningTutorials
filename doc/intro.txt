Welcome to the exciting world of Deep Learning (with theano)!

Deep Learning is about learning multiple levels of representation
and abstraction that help to
make sense of data such as images, sound, and text. 
For more about deep learning algorithms:

 - The ICML 2009 Workshop on Learning Feature Hierarchies `webpage <http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rsalakhu/deeplearning/index.html>`_ has a `reading list <http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rsalakhu/deeplearning/references.html>`_

This tutorial will introduce you to some of the most common deep learning
algorithms and show you how to run them using theano_, a python library.  The
theano library makes writing deep learning models easy, and gives the option of
training them on a GPU.  Since this tutorial is about *using* theano, you
should read over the `theano basic tutorial`_ first before launching into this
one.

of things, and how to treat the tutorials.
