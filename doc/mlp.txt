Multilayer Perceptron
=====================

.. note::
    This section assumes the reader has already read through :doc:`logreg`.
    Additionally, it uses the following new Theano functions and concepts:
    `T.tanh`_, `shared variables`_, `basic arithmetic ops`_, `T.grad`_, 
    :ref:`L1_L2_regularization`.

.. note::
    The code for this section is available for download `here`_.

The next architecture we are going to present using Theano is the single-hidden
layer Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). An MLP can be viewed as a logistic
regressor, where the input is first transformed using a learnt non-linear
transformation :math:`\Phi`. The purpose of this transformation is to project the
input data into a space where it becomes linearly separable. This intermediate
layer is referred to as a **hidden layer**.  A single hidden layer is
sufficient to make MLPs a **universal approximator**. However we will see later
on that there are substantial benefits to using many such hidden layers, i.e. the
very premise of **deep learning**. See these course notes for an `introduction
to MLPs, the back-propagation algorithm, and how to train MLPs <http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~pift6266/H10/notes/mlp.html>`_.

This tutorial will again tackle the problem of MNIST digit classification.

The Model
+++++++++

An MLP (or Artificial Neural Network - ANN) with a single hidden layer
can be represented graphically as
follows:

.. figure:: images/mlp.png
    :align: center

Formally, a one-hidden layer MLP constitutes a function :math:`f: R^D \rightarrow R^L`, 
where :math:`D` is the size of input vector :math:`x`
and :math:`L` is the size of the output vector :math:`f(x)`, such that,
in matrix notation:

.. math::

    f(x) = G( b^{(2)} + W^{(2)}( s( b^{(1)} + W^{(1)} x))),

with bias vectors :math:`b^{(1)}`, :math:`b^{(2)}`; weight matrices
:math:`W^{(1)}`, :math:`W^{(2)}` and activation functions :math:`G` and :math:`s`.

The vector :math:`h(x) = \Phi(x) = s(b^{(1)} + W^{(1)} x)` constitutes the hidden layer.
:math:`W^{(1)} \in R^{D \times D_h}` is the weight matrix connecting the input vector
to the hidden layer.  Each column :math:`W^{(1)}_{\cdot i}` represents the weights
from the input units to the i-th hidden unit. Typical choices for :math:`s`
include :math:`tanh`, with :math:`tanh(a)=(e^a-e^{-a})/(e^a+e^{-a})`,
or the logistic :math:`sigmoid` function, with :math:`sigmoid(a)=1/(1+e^{-a})`. We will be using
:math:`tanh` in this tutorial because it typically yields to faster training
(and sometimes also to better local minima). Both the :math:`tanh`
and :math:`sigmoid` are scalar-to-scalar functions but their natural
extension to vectors and tensors consists in applying them element-wise
(e.g. separately on each element of the vector, yielding a same-size vector).

The output vector is then obtained as: :math:`o(x) = G(b^{(2)} + W^{(2)} h(x))`.
The reader should recognize the form we already used for 
:doc:`logreg`. As before,
class-membership probabilities can be obtained by choosing :math:`G` as the
:math:`softmax` function (in the case of multi-class classification).

To train an MLP, we learn **all** parameters of the model, and here we use
:ref:`opt_SGD` with minibatches.
The set of parameters to learn is the set :math:`\theta =
\{W^{(2)},b^{(2)},W^{(1)},b^{(1)}\}`.  Obtaining the gradients
:math:`\partial{\ell}/\partial{\theta}` can be achieved through the
**backpropagation algorithm** (a special case of the chain-rule of derivation).
Thankfully, since Theano performs automatic differentation, we will not need to
cover this in the tutorial !


Going from logistic regression to MLP
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This tutorial will focus on a single-layer MLP.  The parameters of the model are
therefore :math:`W^{(1)},b^{(1)}` for the hidden layer and
:math:`W^{(2)},b^{(2)}` for the output layer. These parameters need to be
declared as shared variables (as it was done for the logistic regression) :

.. code-block:: python

        # n_in is the dimension of an input vector.
        # n_hidden is the hidden layer dimension.
        # n_out is the number of outputs, which is also the number of classes here.
        # `W1` is initialized with `W1_values` which is uniformly sampled in the
        # interval from -sqrt(6/(n_in+n_hidden)) and sqrt(6/(n_in+n_hidden))
        # (those values are chosen so that when the input is roughly uniform in [-1,1],
        # magnitudes are preserved for activations going upward and for gradients
        # going downward).
        # The output of the uniform random number generator is converted using asarray 
        # to dtype theano.config.floatX so that the code is runnable on GPU.
        W1_values = numpy.asarray( numpy.random.uniform( \
              low = -numpy.sqrt(6/(n_in+n_hidden)), high = numpy.sqrt(6/(n_in+n_hidden)), \
              size = (n_in, n_hidden)), dtype = theano.config.floatX)
        # `W2` is initialized with `W2_values` which are similarly sampled from the
        # interval between -sqrt(6/(n_hidden+n_out)) and sqrt(6/(n_hidden+n_out)).
        # The output of uniform if converted using asarray to dtype 
        # theano.config.floatX so that the code is runable on GPU
        W2_values = numpy.asarray( numpy.random.uniform( 
              low = numpy.sqrt(6/(n_hidden+n_out)), high= numpy.sqrt(6/(n_hidden+n_out)),\
              size= (n_hidden, n_out)), dtype = theano.config.floatX)

        W1 = theano.shared( value = W1_values )
        b1 = theano.shared( value = numpy.zeros((n_hidden,), 
                                                dtype= theano.config.floatX))
        W2 = theano.shared( value = W2_values )
        b2 = theano.shared( value = numpy.zeros((n_out,), 
                                                dtype= theano.config.floatX))




The initial values for the weights of a layer :math:`i` should be uniformly
sampled from the interval
:math:`[-\sqrt{\frac{6}{fan_{in}+fan_{out}}},\sqrt{\frac{6}{fan_{in}+fan_{out}}}]`, where 
:math:`fan_{in}` is the number of units in the :math:`(i-1)`-th layer,
and :math:`fan_{out}` is the number of units in the :math:`i`-th layer. This
initialization ensures that, early in training, each neuron operates in a 
regime of its activation function where information can easily be propagated
both upward (activations flowing from inputs to outputs) and backward
(gradients flowing from outputs to inputs).

Afterwards, we define (symbolically) the hidden layer as follows:

.. code-block:: python

        # symbolic expression computing the values of the hidden layer
        hidden = T.tanh(T.dot(input, W1)+ b1)


Note that we used :math:`tanh` as the activation function of the hidden layer.
The `hidden` layer is then fed to the logistic regression layer by calling:

.. code-block:: python

        # symbolic expression computing the values of the top layer 
        p_y_given_x= T.nnet.softmax(T.dot(hidden, W2)+b2)

        # compute prediction as class whose probability is maximal in 
        # symbolic form
        y_pred = T.argmax( p_y_given_x, axis =1)
 

In this tutorial we will also use L1 and L2 regularization (see
:ref:`L1_L2_regularization`). For this, we need to compute the L1 norm and the squared L2
norm of the weights :math:`W^{(1)}, W^{(2)}`.

.. code-block:: python

        # L1 norm ; one regularization option is to enforce L1 norm to 
        # be small 
        L1     = abs(W1).sum() + abs(W2).sum()

        # square of L2 norm ; one regularization option is to enforce 
        # square of L2 norm to be small
        L2_sqr = (W1**2).sum() + (W2**2).sum()


As before, we train this model using stochastic gradient descent with
mini-batches. The difference is that we modify the cost function to include the
regularization term. ``L1_reg`` and ``L2_reg`` are the hyperparameters
controlling the weight of these regularization terms in the total cost function.
The code that computes the new cost is:

.. code-block:: python

    # the cost we minimize during training is the negative log likelihood of 
    # the model plus the regularization terms (L1 and L2); cost is expressed
    # here symbolically
    cost = classifier.negative_log_likelihood(y) \
         + L1_reg * L1 \
         + L2_reg * L2_sqr 


We then update the parameters of the model using the gradient. This code is
almost identical to the one for logistic regression. Only the number of
parameters differ.

.. code-block:: python

    # compute the gradient of cost with respect to theta = (W1, b1, W2, b2) 
    g_W1 = T.grad(cost, W1)
    g_b1 = T.grad(cost, b1)
    g_W2 = T.grad(cost, W2)
    g_b2 = T.grad(cost, b2)

    # specify how to update the parameters of the model as a dictionary
    updates = \
        { W1: W1 - learning_rate*g_W1 \
        , b1: b1 - learning_rate*g_b1 \
        , W2: W2 - learning_rate*g_W2 \
        , b2: b2 - learning_rate*g_b2 }

    # compiling a theano function `train_model` that returns the cost, but 
    # in the same time updates the parameter of the model based on the rules 
    # defined in `updates`
    train_model = theano.function([minibatch_offset], cost, updates = updates,
            givens={
                x:train_set_x[minibatch_offset:minibatch_offset+batch_size],
                y:train_set_y[minibatch_offset:minibatch_offset+batch_size]})



Putting it All Together
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Having covered the basic concepts, writing an MLP class becomes quite easy.
The code below shows how this can be done, in a way which is analogous to our previous logistic regression implementation.

.. literalinclude:: ../code/mlp.py

The user can then run the code by calling :

.. code-block:: bash

    python code/mlp.py

The output one should expect is of the form :

.. code-block:: bash

  Optimization complete with best validation score of 2.08%, with test performance 2.18%
  The code ran for 55.57 minutes

On an Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU E8400 @ 3.00 Ghz  the code runs with
approximately 0.56 epoch/minute and it took 99 epochs to reach a test
error of 2.18%. 

To put this into perspective, we refer the reader to the results section of `this
<http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist>`_  page.

Tips and Tricks for training MLPs
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are several hyper-parameters in the above code, which are not (and,
generally speaking, cannot be) optimized by gradient descent. Strictly speaking,
finding an optimal set of values for these
hyper-parameters is not a feasible problem. First, we can't simply optimize
each of them independently. Second, we cannot readily apply gradient
techniques that we described previously (partly because some parameters are
discrete values and others are real-valued). Third, the optimization problem
is not convex and finding a (local) minimum would involve a non-trivial
amount of work.

The good news is that over the last 25 years, researchers have devised various
rules of thumb for choosing hyper-parameters in a neural network. A very
good overview of these tricks can be found in `Efficient
BackProp <http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98b.pdf>`_ by Yann LeCun,
Leon Bottou, Genevieve Orr, and Klaus-Robert Mueller. In here, we summarize
the same issues, with an emphasis on the parameters and techniques that we
actually used in our code.

Nonlinearity
--------------

Two of the most common ones are the :math:`sigmoid` and the :math:`tanh` function. For
reasons explained in `Section 4.4  <http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98b.pdf>`_, nonlinearities that
are symmetric around the origin are preferred because they tend to produce
zero-mean inputs to the next layer (which is a desirable property).
Empirically, we have observed that the :math:`tanh` has better convergence
properties.

Weight initialization
---------------------

The rationale for initializing the weights by sampling from 
:math:`uniform[-\frac{1}{\sqrt{fan_{in}}},\frac{1}{\sqrt{fan_{in}}}]` is to
make learning faster at the beginning on training. By initializing with
small random values around the origin, we make sure that the sigmoid
operates in its linear regime, where gradient updates are largest. 

On their own, weights cannot assure that this holds true. As explained in
explained in `Section 4.6 <http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98b.pdf>`_, 
this requires coordination between normalization of inputs (to zero-mean and
standard deviation of 1) and a proper choice of the sigmoid.

Learning rate
--------------

There is a great deal of literature on choosing a good learning rate. The
simplest solution is to simply have a constant rate. Rule of thumb: try
several log-spaced values (:math:`10^{-1},10^{-2},\ldots`) and narrow the
(logarithmic) grid search to the region where you obtain the lowest
validation error.

Decreasing the learning rate over time is sometimes a good idea. One simple
rule for doing that is :math:`\frac{\mu_0}{1 + d\times t}` where
:math:`\mu_0` is the initial rate (chosen, perhaps, using the grid search
technique explained above), :math:`d` is a so-called "decrease constant"
which controls the rate at which the learning rate decreases (typically, a
smaller positive number, :math:`10^{-3}` and smaller) and :math:`t` is the
epoch/stage.

`Section 4.7 <http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98b.pdf>`_ details
procedures for choosing a learning rate for each parameter (weight) in our
network and for choosing them adaptively based on the error of the
classifier.

Number of hidden units
-----------------------

This hyper-parameter is very much dataset-dependent. Vaguely speaking, the
more complicated the input distribution is, the more capacity the network
will require to model it, and so the larger the number of hidden units that
will be needed (note that the number of weights in a layer, perhaps a more direct
measure of capacity, is :math:`D\times D_h` (recall :math:`D` is the number of
inputs and :math:`D_h` is the number of hidden units).

Unless we employ some regularization scheme (early stopping or L1/L2
penalties), a typical number of hidden  units vs. generalization performance graph will be U-shaped.

Regularization parameter
------------------------

Typical values to try for the L1/L2 regularization parameter :math:`\lambda`
are :math:`10^{-2},10^{-3},\ldots`. In the framework that we described so
far, optimizing this parameter will not lead to significantly better
solutions, but is worth exploring nonetheless.
