Energy-Based Models (EBM)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Energy-based** models associate a scalar energy to each configuration of the
variables of interest. Learning corresponds to modifying that energy function
so that its shape has desirable properties. For example, we would like
plausible or desirable configurations to have low energy.  Energy-based
probabilistic models define a probability distribution through an energy
function, as follows:

.. math::
  :label: energy1

  p(x) = \frac {e^{-E(x)}} {Z}.

The normalizing factor :math:`Z` is called the **partition function** by analogy
with physical systems.

.. math::
    Z = \sum_x e^{-E(x)}

An energy-based model can be learnt by performing (stochastic) gradient
descent on the empirical log-likelihood of the training data:

.. math::
    \mathcal{L}(\theta, \mathcal{D}) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{x^{(i)} \in
    \mathcal{D}} log\ p(x^{(i)}).

using the stochastic gradient :math:`\frac{\partial p(x^{(i)})}{\partial
\theta}`, where :math:`\theta` are the parameters of the model.


**EBMs with Hidden Units**

In many cases of interest, we do not observe the example :math:`x` fully, or we
want to introduce some non-observed variables to increase the expressive power
of the model. So we consider an observed part (still denoted :math:`x` here) and a
**hidden** part :math:`h`. We can then write:

.. math::
  :label: energy2

   P(x) = \sum_h P(x,h) = \sum_h \frac{e^{-E(x,h)}}{Z}.

In such cases, to map this formulation to one similar to Eq. :eq:`energy1`, we
introduce the notation (inspired from physics) of **free energy**, defined as
follows:

.. math::
   :label: free_energy

    \mathcal{F}(x) = - \log \sum_h e^{-E(x,h)}

which allows us to write,

.. math::
    &P(x) = \frac{e^{-\mathcal{F}(x)}}{Z} \text{ with } Z=\sum_x e^{-\mathcal{F}(x)}.

The data log-likelihood gradient then has a particularly interesting form.

.. math::
  \frac{\partial log p(x)}{\partial \theta}
   &= - \frac{\partial \mathcal{F}(x)}{\partial \theta} + 
         \sum_{\tilde{x}} p(\tilde{x}) \
             \frac{\partial \mathcal{F}(\tilde{x})}{\partial \theta}.

Notice that the above gradient contains two terms, which are referred to as
the **positive** and **negative phase**. The terms positive and negative do
not refer to the sign of each term in the equation, but rather reflect their
effect on the probability density defined by the model. The first term
increases the probability of training data (by reducing the corresponding free
energy), while the second term decreases the probability of samples generated
by the model.

It is usually difficult to determine this gradient analytically, as it
involves the computation of 
:math:`E_P [ \frac{\partial \mathcal{F}(x)} {\partial \theta} ]`. This is
nothing less than an expectation over all possible configurations of the input
:math:`x` (under the distribution :math:`P` formed by the model) !

The first step in making this computation tractable is to estimate the
expectation using a fixed number of model samples. Samples used to estimate the
negative phase gradient are referred to as **negative particles**, which are
denoted as :math:`\mathcal{N}`. The gradient can then be written as:

.. math::
  :label: bm_grad

  \frac{\partial log p(x)}{\partial \theta}
   &\approx 
   - \frac{\partial \mathcal{F}(x)}{\partial \theta} + 
     \sum_{\tilde{x} \in \mathcal{N}} p(\tilde{x}) \
     \frac{\partial \mathcal{F}(\tilde{x})}{\partial \theta}.

With the above formula, we almost have a pratical, stochastic algorithm for
learning an EBM. The only missing ingredient is how to extract these negative
particles :math:`\mathcal{N}`. While the statistical litterature abounds with
sampling methods, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are especially well suited
for models such as the Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), a specific type of
EBM.


Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Boltzmann Machines (BMs) are a particular form of energy-based model which
contain hidden variables. Restricted Boltzmann Machines further restrict BMs to
those without visible-visible and hidden-hidden connections.  A graphical
depiction of an RBM is shown below.

.. image:: images/rbm.png
    :align: center

The energy function :math:`E(x,h)` of an RBM is defined as:

.. math::
    :label: rbm_energy

    E(v,h) = - b'x - c'h - h'Wx 

where :math:`W` represents the weights connecting hidden and visible units and
:math:`b`, :math:`c` are the offsets of the visible and hidden layers
respectively.

This translates directly to the following free energy formula:

.. math::

  \mathcal{F}(x)= - b'x - \sum_i log \sum_{h_i} e^{h_i (c_i + W_i x)}.

Because of the specific structure of RBMs, visible and hidden units are
conditionally independent given one-another. Using this property, we can
write:

.. math::
    p(h|x) &= \prod_i p(h_i|x) \\
    p(x|h) &= \prod_j p(x_j|h).

**RBMs with binary units**

In the commonly studied case of using binary units (where :math:`h_i \in
\{0,1\}`, we obtain from Eq. :eq:`rbm_energy` and :eq:`energy2`, a stochastic
version of the usual neuron activation function:

.. math::
  :label: rbm_propup

  P(h_i=1|x) = sigm(c_i + W_i x) \\

.. math::
  :label: rbm_propdown

  P(x_j=1|h) = sigm(b_j + W'_j h)

The free energy of an RBM with binary units further simplifies to:

.. math::
  :label: rbm_free_energy   

  \mathcal{F}(x)= - b'x - \sum_i log 1 + e^{(c_i + W_i x)}.

**Update Equations with Binary Units**

Combining Eqs. :eq:`bm_grad` with :eq:`rbm_free_energy`, we obtain the
following log-likelihood gradients for an RBM with binary units:

.. math::
    :label: rbm_grad

    \frac {\partial{log p(v)}} {\partial W_{ij}} &= 
       - x^{(i)}_j \cdot sigm(W_i \cdot x^{(i)} + c_i)
       + E_v[p(h_i|v) \cdot v_j] \\
    \frac {\partial{log p(v)}} {\partial c_i} &=
       - sigm(W_i \cdot x^{(i)}) + E_v[p(h_i|v)] \\
    \frac {\partial{log p(v)}} {\partial b_j} &=
       - x^{(i)}_j + E_v[p(v_j|h)]

For a more detailed derivation of these equations, we refer the reader to the
following `page <http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/twiki/bin/view.cgi/Public/DBNEquations>`_.

.. note::
    We will be updating the tutorial shortly, such that the gradients are
    directly computed (using ``T.grad``) from the free energy formula.


Sampling in an RBM
++++++++++++++++++

Samples of :math:`p(x)` can be obtained by running a Markov chain to
convergence, using Gibbs sampling as the transition operator.

Gibbs sampling of the joint of N random variables :math:`S=(S_1, ... , S_N)`
is done through a sequence of N sampling sub-steps of the form 
:math:`S_i \sim p(S_i | S_{-i})` where :math:`S_{-i}` contains the :math:`N-1`
other random variables in :math:`S` excluding :math:`S_i`.

For RBMs, :math:`S` consists of the set of visible and hidden units. However,
since they are conditionally independent, one can perform block Gibbs
sampling. In this setting, visible units are sampled simultaneously given
fixed values of the hidden units. Similarly, hidden units are sampled
simultaneously given the visibles. A step in the Markov chain is thus taken as
follows: 

.. math::
    h^{(n+1)} &\sim sigm(W'x^{(n)} + c) \\
    x^{(n+1)} &\sim sigm(W h^{(n+1)} + b),

where :math:`h^{(n)}` refers to the set of all hidden units at the n-th step of
within the Markov chain.

This can be illustrated graphically:

.. image:: images/markov_chain.png
    :align: center

As :math:`t \rightarrow \infty`, samples :math:`(x^{(t)}, h^{(t)})` are
guaranteed to be accurate samples of :math:`p(x,h)`.

In theory, each parameter update in the learning process would require running
one such chain to convergence. It is needless to say that doing so would be
prohibitively expensive. As such, several algorithms have been devised for
RBMs, in order to efficiently sample from :math:`p(x,h)` during the learning
process.


Contrastive Divergence (CD-k)
-----------------------------

Contrastive Divergence uses two tricks to speed up the sampling process:

* since we eventually want :math:`p(x) \approx p_T(x)` (the true, underlying
  distribution of the data), we initialize the Markov chain with a training
  example.
  
* CD does not wait for the chain to converge. Samples are obtained after only
  k-steps of Gibbs sampling. In pratice, :math:`k=1` has been shown to work
  surprisingly well.


Persistent CD
-------------

Persistent CD [Tieleman08]_ uses another approximation for sampling from
:math:`p(x,h)`.  It relies on a single Markov chain, which has a persistent
state. For each parameter update, we extract new samples by simply running the
chain for k-steps. The state of the chain is then preserved for subsequent updates.

The general intuition is that if parameter updates are small enough compared
to the mixing rate of the chain, the Markov chain should be able to "catch up"
to changes in the model.


Implementation
++++++++++++++

We construct an ``RBM`` class. The parameters of the network can either be
initialized by the constructor or can be passed as arguments. This option is
useful when a RBM is used as the building block of a deep network, in which
case the weight matrix and the hidden layer bias is shared with the
corresponding sigmoidal layer of a MLP network.

.. code-block:: python

  class RBM(object):
    """Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) """
    def __init__(self, input=None, n_visible=784, n_hidden=500, \
        W = None, hbias = None, vbias = None, numpy_rng = None,

        """ 
        RBM constructor. Defines the parameters of the model along with
        basic operations for inferring hidden from visible (and vice-versa), 
        as well as for performing CD updates.

        self.n_visible = n_visible
        self.n_hidden  = n_hidden


        if W is None : 
           # W is initialized with `initial_W` which is uniformely sampled
           # from -6./sqrt(n_visible+n_hidden) and 6./sqrt(n_hidden+n_visible)
           # the output of uniform if converted using asarray to dtype

                     low = -numpy.sqrt(6./(n_hidden+n_visible)),

           # create shared variable for hidden units bias
           hbias = theano.shared(value = numpy.zeros(n_hidden,

            vbias = theano.shared(value =numpy.zeros(n_visible, 
                                dtype = theano.config.floatX),name='vbias')

        if theano_rng is None : 
            theano_rng = RandomStreams(numpy_rng.randint(2**30))


        # initialize input layer for standalone RBM or layer0 of DBN
        self.input = input if input else T.dmatrix('input')

        self.W          = W

        self.vbias      = vbias
        self.theano_rng = theano_rng
        # **** WARNING: It is not a good idea to put things in this list 
        # other than shared variables created in this function.
        self.params     = [self.W, self.hbias, self.vbias]
        self.batch_size = self.input.shape[0]


Next step is to define functions which defines the symbolic graph associated
with Eqs. :eq:`rbm_propup` - :eq:`rbm_propdown`. The code is as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    def sample_h_given_v(self, v0_sample):
        ''' This function infers state of hidden units given visible units '''
        # compute the activation of the hidden units given a sample of the visibles
        h1_mean = T.nnet.sigmoid(T.dot(v0_sample, self.W) + self.hbias)
        # get a sample of the hiddens given their activation
        h1_sample = self.theano_rng.binomial(size = h1_mean.shape, n = 1, prob = h1_mean)
        return [h1_mean, h1_sample]

    def sample_v_given_h(self, h0_sample):
        ''' This function infers state of visible units given hidden units '''
        # compute the activation of the visible given the hidden sample
        v1_mean = T.nnet.sigmoid(T.dot(h0_sample, self.W.T) + self.vbias)
        # get a sample of the visible given their activation
        v1_sample = self.theano_rng.binomial(size = v1_mean.shape,n = 1,prob = v1_mean)
        return [v1_mean, v1_sample]

We can then use these functions to define the symbolic graph for a Gibbs
sampling step. We define two functions:

* ``gibbs_vhv`` which performs a step of Gibbs sampling starting from the
  visible units. As we shall see, this will be useful for sampling from the
  RBM.

* ``gibbs_hvh`` which performs a step of Gibbs sampling starting from the hidden units. 
  This function will be useful for performing CD and PCD updates.

The code is as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    def gibbs_hvh(self, h0_sample):
        ''' This function implements one step of Gibbs sampling, 
            starting from the hidden state'''
        v1_mean, v1_sample = self.sample_v_given_h(h0_sample)
        h1_mean, h1_sample = self.sample_h_given_v(v1_sample)
        return [v1_mean, v1_sample, h1_mean, h1_sample]
 
    def gibbs_vhv(self, v0_sample):
        ''' This function implements one step of Gibbs sampling, 
            starting from the visible state'''
        h1_mean, h1_sample = self.sample_h_given_v(v0_sample)
        v1_mean, v1_sample = self.sample_v_given_h(h1_sample)
        return [h1_mean, h1_sample, v1_mean, v1_sample]


We then add a ``cd`` method, whose purpose is to generate the symbolic
gradients for CD-1 and PCD-1 updates.

.. code-block:: python

    def cd(self, lr = 0.1, persistent=None):
        """ This functions implements one step of CD-1 """

        # compute positive phase
        ph_mean, ph_sample = self.sample_h_given_v(self.input)

        # decide how to initialize persistent chain:
        # for CD, we use the newly generate hidden sample
        # for PCD, we initialize from the old state of the chain
        if persistent is None:
            chain_start = ph_sample
        else:
            chain_start = persistent

        # perform actual negative phase
        [nv_mean, nv_sample, nh_mean, nh_sample] = self.gibbs_hvh(chain_start)


Note that ``cd`` takes as argument a variable called ``persistent``. While this
may be confusing to the reader (since CD is by definition **not** persistent),
this little trick allows us to use the same code to implement both CD and PCD.
To use PCD, ``persistent`` should refer to a shared variable which contains the
state of the Gibbs chain from the previous iteration.

If ``persistent`` is ``None``, we initialize the Gibbs chain with the hidden
sample generated during the positive phase. Once we have established the
starting point of the chain, we can then compute the values of the visible and
hidden units in both the positive and negative phases. These are required to
compute the gradients of Eq. :eq:`rbm_grad`.

.. code-block:: python

        # determine gradients on RBM parameters
        g_vbias = T.sum( self.input - nv_mean, axis = 0)/self.batch_size
        g_hbias = T.sum( ph_mean    - nh_mean, axis = 0)/self.batch_size
        g_W = T.dot(ph_mean.T, self.input   )/ self.batch_size - \
              T.dot(nh_mean.T, nv_mean      )/ self.batch_size

        gparams = [g_W.T, g_hbias, g_vbias]

Finally, we construct the updates dictionary containing the parameter
updates. In case of PCD, these should also update the shared variable
containing the state of the Gibbs chain.

.. code-block:: python

        # constructs the update dictionary
        updates = {}
        for gparam, param in zip(gparams, self.params):
           updates[param] = param + gparam * lr

        if persistent:
            # Note that this works only if persistent is a shared variable
            updates[persistent] = T.cast(nh_sample, dtype=theano.config.floatX)


        return updates

We now have all the necessary ingredients to start training our network.

Before going over the training loop however, the reader should familiarize
himself with the function ``tile_raster_images`` (see :ref:`how-to-plot`). Since
RBMs are generative models, we are interested in sampling from them and
plotting/visualizing these samples. We also want to visualize the filters
(weights) learnt by the RBM, to gain insights into what the RBM is actually
doing. Bare in mind however, that this does not provide the entire story,
since we neglect the biases and plot the weights up to a multiplicative
constant (weights are converted to values between 0 and 1). 

Having these utility functions, we can start training the RBM and plot/save
the filters after each training epoch.  We train the RBM using PCD, as it has
been shown to lead to a better generative model ([Tieleman]_).

.. code-block:: python

    for epoch in xrange(training_epochs):

        # go through the training set
        c = []
        for batch_index in xrange(n_train_batches):
           train_rbm(batch_index)

        print 'Training epoch %d '%epoch

        # Plot filters after each training epoch
        plotting_start = time.clock()
        # Construct image from the weight matrix 
        image = PIL.Image.fromarray(tile_raster_images( X = rbm.W.value.T,
                 img_shape = (28,28),tile_shape = (10,10), 
                 tile_spacing=(1,1)))
        image.save('filters_at_epoch_%i.png'%epoch) 
        plotting_stop = time.clock()
        plotting_time += (plotting_stop - plotting_start)

    end_time = time.clock()

    pretraining_time = (end_time - start_time) - plotting_time

    print ('Training took %f minutes' %(pretraining_time/60.))

Once the RBM is trained, we can then use the ``gibbs_vhv`` function to implement
the Gibbs chain required for sampling. We initialize the Gibbs chain starting
from test examples (although we could as well pick it from the training set)
in order to speed up convergence and avoid problems with random
initialization.

.. code-block:: python

    #################################
    #     Sampling from the RBM     #
    #################################

    # find out the number of test samples  
    number_of_test_samples = test_set_x.value.shape[0]

    # pick two initial starting points randomly 
    sample = rng.randint(number_of_test_samples-20)

    # Initialize the persistent chain with some sample from the test 
    persistent_vis_chain = theano.shared(test_set_x.value[sample:sample+20])

Next we create the 20 persistent chains in paralel to get our
samples. To do so, we compile a theano function which performs one Gibbs step
and updates the state of the persistent chain with the new visible sample. We
apply this function iteratively for a large number of steps, plotting the
samples at every 1000 step.

.. code-block:: python

    # define one step of Gibbs sampling (mf = mean-field)
    [hid_mf, hid_sample, vis_mf, vis_sample] =  rbm.gibbs_vhv(persistent_vis_chain)

    # the sample at the end of the channel is returned by ``gibbs_1`` as 
    # its second output; note that this is computed as a binomial draw, 
    # therefore it is formed of ints (0 and 1) and therefore needs to 
    # be converted to the same dtype as ``persistent_vis_chain``
    vis_sample = T.cast(vis_sample, dtype=theano.config.floatX)

    # construct the function that implements our persistent chain 
    # we generate the "mean field" activations for plotting and the actual samples for
    # reinitializing the state of our persistent chain
    sample_fn = theano.function([], [vis_mf, vis_sample],
                      updates = { persistent_vis_chain:vis_sample})

    # sample the RBM, plotting every `plot_every`-th sample; do this 
    # until you plot at least `n_samples`
    n_samples = 10
    plot_every = 1000

    for idx in xrange(n_samples):
        # do `plot_every` intermediate samplings of which we do not care
        for jdx in  xrange(plot_every):
            vis_mf, vis_sample = sample_fn()

        # construct image
        image = PIL.Image.fromarray(tile_raster_images( 
                                         X          = vis_mf,
                                         img_shape  = (28,28),
                                         tile_shape = (10,10),
                                         tile_spacing = (1,1) ) )
        print ' ... plotting sample ', idx
        image.save('sample_%i_step_%i.png'%(idx,idx*jdx))
